    <title>Huevos Con Chorizo</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The name pretty much says it all: This is a simple breakfast dish of eggs scrambled with chorizo. As with most simple dishes, the quality of ingredients really matters, so try to find good -- in this case, fatty and spicy -- chorizo to carry the dish. The amount of fat it renders while frying will determine how much extra oil you'll need to add. Mexican chorizo is sold either loose or in links; if yours is the latter, remove it from the casing to fry. Word of caution make sure you buy Mexican Chorizo, not Spasnish Chorizo.  </p>
