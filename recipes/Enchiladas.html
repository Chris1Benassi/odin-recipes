        <li>Vegetable Oil for Frying</li>
        <li>6 Corn Tortillas</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 Cups of Shredded Chicken</li>
        <li>1/2 Shredded Oaxaca or Mozzarella Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>directions</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven 350 F</li>
        <li>Put the tomatillos, onion and both chiles in a medium heavy saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Boil until the tomatillos turn an olive-green color, about 10 minutes. Drain and transfer the tomatillos, onions and chiles to a blender. Add the garlic and cilantro and blend until smooth. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. </li>
        <li>Mix the Mexican crema and heavy cream together in a small bowl and season with salt. Set aside. </li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the tortillas until golden but still pliable, about 10 seconds per side, using more oil if needed. Transfer to paper towels to drain.</li>
        <li>Place the tortillas on a work surface. Divide the shredded chicken evenly among the tortillas and roll up each like a cigar. Spread 1/3 cup of the sauce in a 13-by-9-by-2-inch glass baking dish. Arrange the enchiladas in 1 layer, seam-side down, snugly inside the dish. Pour the rest of the sauce over the enchiladas. Drizzle the cream mixture on top and sprinkle the cheese all over.</li>
        <li>Bake until the cheese is melted and starting to brown in spots, about 30 minutes. Server immediately</li>
